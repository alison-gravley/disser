# Note that commands or scripts that need sudoers permissions will either need
# to be put here in clear text, or you need to edit your sudoers permissions
# to not ask for a password for the specific commands.

# Destination is optional
# Understand that you can use wildcards, but you will need a destination
# directory in that case.
# You can use relative paths for your input, but will need destination as well
